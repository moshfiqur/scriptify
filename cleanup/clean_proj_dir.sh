# Project Cleaner Script
#
# Description:
# This script recursively traverses a specified directory and deletes folders
# that typically contain dependencies, version control data, or build artifacts.
#
# It targets and deletes:
#   1. `node_modules` - Common in Node.js/JavaScript projects.
#   2. `.git` - The hidden directory for Git version control repositories.
#   3. `build` - A common output directory for Flutter, C++, and other projects.
#
# Usage:
#   ./clean.sh /path/to/your/projects_folder
#   ./clean.sh /path/to/your/projects_folder --dry-run
#
# Options:
#   --dry-run   Run the script without deleting any files. It will only print
#               the paths of the folders that would be deleted.
#
# Safety:
#   - The script will ask for confirmation before deleting anything unless
#     --dry-run is specified.
#   - It uses 'set -e' to exit immediately if any command fails.
# ==============================================================================

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
set -e
